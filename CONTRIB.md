TODO: explain how to add tutorials

## Building the website locally

First, you may need to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides).

If you have that working, then from the `docs/` directory, run:

```
bundle install
```

and

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Alternatively, provided you're on the main branch, any changes you commit should be live at https://irrationalpie7.github.io/audio-tutorials/ within a few minutes.
