# About

This is a site to collect audio tutorials, specifically I was thinking a reference to what different audio problems look like in a spectrogram and some ways to address those problems, with screenshots and audio files.

The files for this project are hosted [on Github](https://github.com/irrationalpie7/audio-tutorials), where you can [file issues or feature requests](https://github.com/irrationalpie7/audio-tutorials/issues) or [contribute a tutorial of your own](https://github.com/irrationalpie7/audio-tutorials/blob/main/CONTRIB.md)!

TODO: Link a google form to accept requests for new tutorials, or contributions of new tutorials (e.g. via shared gdoc).
